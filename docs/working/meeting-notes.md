# Meeting Notes

User-stated decisions and verified working facts are recorded here by date. Do not treat unstated product, architecture, ML, or deployment ideas as confirmed.

- The user first asked for a Mapbox web view that shows Yeungnam University buildings well.
- The direction was then expanded beyond a Yeungnam-only map. Yeungnam University should be the first concrete demo case, but the system should support multiple schools later.
- The user clarified that the product goal is not only a map. It is a campus energy platform that lets schools see electricity usage, forecast usage, and savings.
- Admin and facility-team users should be able to identify which buildings are using more electricity than predicted.
- The user plans to add a prediction model later, such as LightGBM, to estimate expected electricity usage.
- The user stated that energy is often not saved because the actual actors, such as students and faculty, lack interest, not only because monitoring systems are missing.
- The product should therefore include a competition or engagement system.
- Participants should register their school and affiliation.
- If their school or affiliation saves electricity compared with predicted usage, that saving should become points or another reward format.
- The reward should be used to grow a character, with an RPG-style experience later.
- The product should have two UI surfaces: an administrator-facing advanced energy dashboard and a user-facing participation and character experience.
- The implementation plan should be reset from a Yeungnam-only Mapbox view to a campus energy platform MVP that uses Yeungnam as the first school.
- The first campus energy MVP was implemented and pushed as `94560de Add campus energy MVP`.
- The implemented MVP contains admin and participant modes, mock Yeungnam energy data, shared energy comparison and scoring logic, a Mapbox-backed admin map with a missing-token fallback, and Vitest domain tests.
- The verified checks for the MVP were `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check`.
- `.env.example` leaves `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` blank so the repository does not contain a Mapbox-looking token value.

- The user preferred manual session recording over always-on background logging.
- Recording mode should start only when the user explicitly asks with phrases such as `정리 시작`, `세션 정리해줘`, `기록해줘`, or `회의록 정리해줘`.

## 2026-06-18

- The user explored the idea of a system that records project context from Codex sessions.
- The idea was described as close to a `session recorder`, `context logger`, `agent session recorder`, or `session logging harness`.

## 2026-06-17

- The user said the existing docs contained planning content that no longer matched the desired direction.
- The old planning docs should not be preserved as the baseline.
- Going forward, docs should work more like meeting notes: user statements and facts verified during work should be accumulated gradually.
